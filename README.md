**Please note: this project is hosted on the free tier of Render, and as such it may take a minute to load if it hasn't been accessed in a while. Free Render lets applications go dormant when they are not in use.**

## DayBreaker is a simple Daily Task organizer
It's main objective is to provide a minimally worded task list upon loading, with checkboxes for completing tasks.
The back-end was created with Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose to support the React front end.

## Please find the React folder on GitHub
